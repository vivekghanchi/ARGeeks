## Updated App coming Soon !!


This is an Augmented Reality application which will help in learning  about Wild life animal by creating an augmented Zoo and Spread awareness of endangered animals in a fun way. It will make learning accurate and get the most from it.

## Description of Project

 Augmented reality is a new way to interact with technology in the 21st century.

Augmented Reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment whereby the objects that reside in the real-world are "augmented" by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory, and olfactory.

We are harnessing the power of augmented reality and computer vision to develop an application which will let the user experience an augmented zoo of endangered and extinct species and spread awareness toward endangered species as well, the government is trying very hard to maintain the population of these endangered species and spend a lot of money to gain public support for their endeavours. We are trying to make this a little easier for the government to do its job by attracting people toward AR technology and spreading awareness at the same time.

We are using computer vision to scan for defined images of these species and augmenting their behavior with the latest AR development engines, in addition to it the user will get an experience of observing the augmented behavior of the extinct species which were to this point were only documented with pictures or videos. the user of this solution will, in essence, can experience an augmented recreation of the extinct speices.
